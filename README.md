## Getting Started

#### *** Encryption formats supported ***
- AES-256 (ECB or CBC)
- Base-64
- SHA-1
- MD5
- Binary (Base-2)
- Hexadecimal (Base-16)

#### *** Supported decryption formats ***
- AES-256 (ECB or CBC)
- Base-64
- Binary (Base-2)
- Hexadecimal (Base-16)

#### *** FaQ ***
- "Why are there fewer decryption formats than encryption formats?"
Some of them, like SHA-1 and MD5, are hashing formats and because of the way they are designed, they cannot be decrypted conventionally.
- "Why does it raise a 'parameters' error when I try to encrypt my text in AES-256? "
The written key/password must be 16 or 32 characters long.
- "Why does it raise an 'input' error when I try to decrypt my ciphertext? "
The written input may be the wrong format or incomplete
